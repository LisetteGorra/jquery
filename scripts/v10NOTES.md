V10 NOTES

WRAPPING AND UNWRAPPING OF ELEMENTS

- Wrapping means elements that are surrounded by parent elements 

- You can wrap all the o tags in a div tag 

WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO WRAP ELEMENTS?

EXAMPLE:  If you have a form and you don't want anyone to be able to submit it without filling every form field you can wrap the submit button in a div tag and then use unwrap once all the form fields have been filled out

the unwrap method is styled to disable that button so that people can click it after
